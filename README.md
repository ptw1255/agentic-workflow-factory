# Agentic Workflow Factory

Agentic Workflow Factory is a visual, API-first runtime for composing deterministic
code, bounded agents, human approvals, connectors, evaluators, and consumers into
durable workflows. Each node is a versioned work unit with an explicit contract;
each agent is a policy-bound box with declared purpose, skills, tools, budgets,
boundaries, approvals, and telemetry rules.

The product is designed for software and operations teams that want agents to do
useful work without turning the system into an opaque autonomous process. A typical
flow can validate an issue, run deterministic preparation code, ask an agent to plan
or implement a change, execute tests, route to human review, and publish evidence.

The implementation lives under [`src/`](src/). The product and factory roadmaps
remain at the repository root and under [`FACTORY/`](FACTORY/).

## Status

The repository is an actively developed MVP. The current release includes the visual
Studio, versioned workflows and agent boxes, a local durable executor, Temporal
workflow definitions, PostgreSQL persistence, Vault-backed local secrets, standardized
OpenTelemetry/OpenInference-style telemetry, bounded proposals, and factory metrics.
The model-provider and repository-execution adapters are intentionally explicit next
steps rather than hidden capabilities.

## Run locally

Requires Node.js 22 or newer.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open <http://localhost:5173>. Vite proxies `/api` requests to the Fastify server on
port 3100. Without `DATABASE_URL`, runtime state is stored in `.data/state.json`.
Without Vault configuration, credential writes are rejected rather than persisted.

Useful commands:

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run build
npm run demo
npm run server
```

## Run with Docker Desktop

Docker Desktop can run the app and PostgreSQL together:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Open <http://localhost:3100>. The app persists its control-plane state in PostgreSQL;
the `postgres_data` volume keeps it across restarts. The `DATABASE_URL` environment
variable selects the PostgreSQL adapter. If it is omitted, the server falls back to
the local JSON store at `.data/state.json`.

Compose also starts a local Vault development server on port `8200`. Connection API
keys are written to Vault and represented in PostgreSQL only by an opaque reference.
The Compose Vault token is intentionally `dev-only-token`; this setup is for local
development and must not be used with production credentials.

PostgreSQL stores workflow and run control-plane state in `platform_state` and keeps
runtime logs, traces, and metrics in the indexed `observability_events` table. Legacy
JSON state events are moved into that table automatically on first startup. Runtime
observability retention is 48 hours by default; a cleanup pass runs at startup and
every 15 minutes and removes older records.

### Tenants and projects

The runtime is one shared installation that can host multiple isolated projects
(the product abstraction for a loop). A tenant owns projects; workflows, agent boxes,
connections, runs, proposals, and telemetry are scoped to a project. Existing local
data is migrated into `tenant-local` / `project-local`. API clients can select a
scope with `X-Tenant-ID` and `X-Project-ID` headers; omitted headers use the local
defaults. Create a new project with `POST /api/projects`, then clone a workflow into
it with `POST /api/projects/:projectId/workflows`.

### Phoenix traces (optional)

Phoenix is an optional local trace UI and OTLP receiver. The factory exports trace
events to Phoenix and can also fan out logs and metrics to any OTLP/HTTP endpoint.
Phoenix traces are deleted by the same 48-hour cleanup pass through Phoenix's trace
API; Phoenix is configured with a two-day default retention policy as a second safety
net. Phoenix's own scheduled policy cleanup can be less frequent, so keep the
factory cleanup process running when a strict 48-hour boundary matters.

Start the optional Phoenix container with Docker Desktop:

```bash
PHOENIX_ENDPOINT=http://phoenix:6006 \
  docker compose --profile observability up --build
```

Then open <http://localhost:6006>. To export all three signals to another OTLP/HTTP
backend, set `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` as well. The app accepts
`OBSERVABILITY_RETENTION_HOURS` (default `48`), but deployments should keep it at
48 hours when the product's short-retention policy is required. An external OTLP
backend must also be configured with its own 48-hour TTL; the factory cannot delete
records from arbitrary third-party storage.

`npm run check` runs type checking, tests, and the production web build.

## Product workflow

```text
Define work units → validate contracts → simulate → version → run durably
       ↓                   ↓                 ↓          ↓
 agent boxes          deterministic code   approvals   correlated evidence
```

Work units exchange persisted outputs and schema metadata. Deterministic units are
appropriate for normalization, validation, transforms, and tests; agent units are
bounded by an agent box and may only use declared tools and connections. Agents
propose changes, while policy and human approval control promotion.

## Product surfaces

- **Studio:** edit a typed workflow on a React Flow canvas, configure nodes, validate,
  define policy-bound agent boxes, save immutable versions, retrieve version history
  through the API, and launch runs.
- **Runs:** inspect status, cost, human touchpoints, node events, agent iterations,
  failures, and approval waits.
- **Connections:** manage non-secret connector metadata, environment bindings, scopes,
  health, and use.
- **Agent proposals:** turn an outcome into a reviewable, bounded workflow proposal.
  The included planner is deterministic so the repository runs without external AI
  credentials; its service boundary can be replaced with a model-backed planner.
- **Factory:** view throughput, success, cost, automation, human burden, and
  stage-level performance.

Agent-loop nodes must reference an agent box declared in the workflow definition.
Each box versions its purpose, instructions, skills, tools, model route, input/output
schemas, connection and repository boundaries, budgets, termination rules, approval
gates, and telemetry redaction policy. Runtime events use a shared OpenTelemetry-style
envelope (logs, traces, and metrics) with OpenInference attributes for agent spans;
prompt and output capture is opt-in per agent.

Every node is also a versioned work unit with declared input/output schema names,
timeouts, retry count, and idempotency metadata. Deterministic code units use a
small allow-listed operation set (`uppercase`, `lowercase`, `trim`, and JSON
parse/stringify) and persist their outputs for downstream units; arbitrary code
execution remains a separate sandboxed integration boundary.

## Architecture

```text
src/
  agents/          # Reviewable workflow proposal service
  connections/     # Credential-free connection metadata and health
  domain/          # Canonical schemas, graph validator, catalog, and types
  factory/         # Factory manifest and metrics
  observability/   # Correlated run event service
  runtime/         # Persistent local preview executor and approvals
  server/          # API-first Fastify control plane
  storage/         # JSON development and PostgreSQL control-plane persistence
  temporal/        # Durable Temporal workflow and activity worker
  web/             # React dashboard and workflow studio
```

The deployment shape is intentionally shared: one control-plane container serves
many projects, while PostgreSQL, Vault, Temporal workers, and optional Phoenix remain
separate services. Resource-heavy or untrusted work can later move to isolated worker
containers without creating a new platform container for every loop.

The local executor makes development self-contained and explicitly reports itself as
`local-durable-preview`. It checkpoints each unit to persistent state, supports
bounded agent loops and human approval/resume, and records correlated telemetry. For
a Temporal deployment, run a Temporal service and start:

```bash
TEMPORAL_ADDRESS=localhost:7233 npm run worker
```

The generic Temporal workflow pins a full definition, executes nondeterministic work
in activities, uses a signal for approvals, and applies activity retry policy. Docker
Compose provides PostgreSQL and a local Vault development server for an end-to-end
control-plane setup.

## Safety model

- Unknown node types, orphaned edges, cycles, duplicate IDs, trigger mismatches, and
  unbounded agent loops are rejected before execution.
- Agent output is a proposal against a known workflow version and cannot deploy.
- Workflow saves use optimistic version checks.
- Connections contain metadata and scopes; secret values are brokered through Vault
  and never enter workflow definitions, PostgreSQL state, or telemetry.
- HTTP activities enforce protocol checks, timeouts, and surfaced failures.
- Human approval, cancellation, costs, tool-like actions, and node transitions are
  auditable events.
